				<h2 class="head">Electric Guitar</h2>	
				<p class="content">
				It was around 1936 when a jazz guitarist named Charlie Christian (1916-1942) began using an acoustic guitar with a pickup attached to the body, to play solos. This is said to be the birth of the electric guitar. People had already been thinking about solid-body guitars by the beginning of the 1940s. However, the first such instrument on the market was by designed by Leo Fender, the famous manufacturer of guitar amplifiers. 
				</p>
				<p class="content">
				An electric guitar is structured from a wooden body with parts such as a pickup installed and strung with steel strings. The bodies of these guitars are treated to look like metal or plastic and are often quite colorful, so some people may not realize that the instruments are actually made from wood.

				If you are a fan of rock or blues music, you have likely heard what is called slide guitar playing. Instead of pressing the strings with his or her fingers, a guitarist slides a bar along the strings. It is said that this style of playing was originally at attempt to somehow approximate the rolling feeling of the blues with a guitar.

					piano's ancestry can be traced back through various instruments such as the clavichord, harpsichord, and dulcimer. But if it were traced back even further, one would find that the piano is a descendant of the monochord. In other words, based on its ancestry the piano can be classified as a string instrument.

					Johann Andreas Stein improved upon the Silbermann piano mechanism and developed what would later be called the Viennese action, a new system that was used for many years and gained much popularity. This new piano featured a bright tone quality and a keyboard that responded well to the player's touch. Mozart fell in love with these aspects of the new instrument, on which he wrote many renowned piano pieces.

					Richter said this about pianos. <q>In a really good piano, the sensitivity of the heart, the sensitivity of the heart that reacts to the music is good. In other words, when you want to make a sad sound, it has to sound sadly, and when you want to make a joyful sound, it has to sound joyfully.</q>

					As the "keeper of the rhythm," the drum provides the foundation for the overall sound of music. Producing sounds by beating things served not just as accompaniment to dancing but also as a means of communicating with other people over long distances. It has also been used effectively to move the hearts and minds of people, such as in religious ceremonies.

					At the end of the nineteenth century, the snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, and other percussion instruments were first gathered into a "drum kit" that could be played by one person. The man attributed with starting this evolution is said to be a snare drummer named Dee Dee Chandler. He devised a way to play the bass drum by stepping on a pedal with his right foot.

					It looks like a hat or some kitchen utensil, and it has a bright, clear tone like a chime, if used skillfully, can add a nice accent to a song.One of the interesting aspects of the bell is that, in contrast to the traditional cymbal, it has a distinct pitch, and by using several with different pitches, musical phrases can be created.

					<h2 class="head">Saxophone</h2>
					<p class="content">
						The saxophone is only a few instruments in wide use today known to be invented by a single individual. His idea was to create an instrument that combined the best qualities of a woodwind instrument with the best qualities of a brass instrument, and in the 1840s he conceived the saxophone. This invention was patented in Paris in 1846.
					</p>
					<p class="content">
					The saxophone is loved by both jazz and classical musicians, but the qualities demanded of the instrument are different for each genre. With jazz, the ideal instrument allows players to express their individuality, and so they like a saxophone with a greater taper (a high angle of graduation). The raspy tones and buzz of the instrument contribute to the texture of the music.
					</p>
					<p class="content">
					"The Girl from Arles," opus 23 is played even today by orchestras, and Bizet was probably one of the first composers to adopt the saxophone. In "The Girl from Arles," the saxophone plays one of the woodwind parts. The saxophone is much louder than the other woodwinds, so this could be called a very bold experiment.

					<p class="content">
					Whether performing an elegant solo or being the heart of the orchestra, the violin is a "star" in the music world.Instruments like the violin that use a bow to produce a sound are called bowed stringed instruments. The Arabian rabab and the rebec, which came from the orient in the middle ages and was played widely in Spain and France, are said to be the ancestors of the violin.	
					</p>
					<p class="content">
					Vibrations from the strings are transmitted to the top plate and bottom plate through the bridge, and this reverberates within the hollow body, producing the rich, brilliant tone characteristic of the violin.A bowed string vibrates and moves in a circular motion that produces the fundamental tone, while the vibration produces overtones like a rippling wave. This complex movement of the string is transmitted to the body by the bridge
					</p>
					<p class="content">
					Horsehair graces the bow for violins and cellos, and each bow has about 150 individual hairs. Horsehair has many small bumps that cannot be seen with the naked eye, and those bumps create the friction that produces the characteristic subtle weeping tone of the violin.
